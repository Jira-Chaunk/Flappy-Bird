# Flappy Bird in Java

Welcome to the Flappy Bird game implemented in Java! This project is a simple clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, created to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and Java game development.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure:

```
Flappy Bird/
│
├── src/
│   ├── App.java
│   ├── FlappyBird.java
│   └── assets/
│       ├── bird.png
│       ├── pipe.png
│       ├── background.png
│       └── ...
```

- **App.java:** The entry point for the game, responsible for setting up the game window and starting the game loop.
- **FlappyBird.java:** Contains the main game logic, including the bird’s movement, pipe generation, collision detection, and scoring.
- **assets/:** A folder containing all the images used in the game, such as the bird, pipes, and background.

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jira-Chaunk/Flappy-Bird/tree/main
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd FlappyBird/src
   ```

3. **Compile and Run:**
   - You can compile the project using any Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
   - Alternatively, compile and run it from the command line:
     ```bash
     javac App.java
     java App
     ```

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Objective:** Guide the bird through the gaps in the pipes to score points.
- **Controls:** 
  - Press the **spacebar** or **click** the mouse to make the bird flap its wings and fly upward.
  - Avoid colliding with the pipes or the ground.

## 🛠️ Customization

Feel free to modify the code to add new features, adjust the difficulty, or change the appearance of the game by replacing the images in the `assets/` folder.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **High Score Tracking:** Implement a feature to save and display the highest score achieved.
- **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for flapping, scoring, and collisions.
- **Additional Levels:** Create different levels or difficulties with varying pipe speeds and gaps.
